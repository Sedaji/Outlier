I have a bit of a love / hate relationship with futuredarts. I got the size 31
and they were super tight. So I ordered the size 32 but then they were too
loose. I think I will re-order the size 31 again and hope they will loosen up.
I know f.cloth doesn't loosen as much as workcloth does, but who knows. The
Flat-Black futureworks are so gorgeous and works really well in an office
setting.
