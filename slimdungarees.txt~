These are pretty good! I got the Bluetint Grays. The size 32 was quite tight
even though the website said it had a top opening of 16.5" (My usual size).
After a day or two of wearing it however, it loosened up quite nicely! I like
the style of these as they remind me of jeans but the material is something
else! Workcloth truly is amazing and you have to feel it for yourself.
